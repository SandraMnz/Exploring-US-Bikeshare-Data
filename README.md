# Exploring-US-Bikeshare-Data
This project was completed as part of the course requirements of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree certification.

The default repo branch contains an updated version of the project utilizing Numpy and Pandas.

## Overview

The project used data provided by [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com), a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. The project examined usage patterns in three major US cities - Chicago, Washington and New York.

An interactive experience was created to allow users to select data for a specific city and filter the data by a specific month or day of the week.

The user was provided with information on metrics such as most common start day/time, average trip duration, most common start station or end station and trip.
